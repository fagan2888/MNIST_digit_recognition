# MNIST_digit_recognition
MNIST hand-written digit recognition by fully-connected and convolutional neural networks - boiler plate code for easy reproduction and tutorial purpose.

### Update:
This is a old code example from 2017 and Tensorflow has changed a lot since then. It may not run properly now :-)
